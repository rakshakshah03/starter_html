        <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
        <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

        <img src="images/Dollar1.jpg" alt="Black, white and brown australian shepherd in a playpen looking up with a food bowl and towels on the side" width=400>
        <p>Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch. Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with him. At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to let them know that he wants pets. </p>
        <p>Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits with eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart and will only do tricks when you present him with snacks.             </p>

        <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">
                    <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
                    <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

            <p>Rosie is a small but super energetic dog. Whenever someone comes to the house she is 
            very quick to run up and greet them. She loves to play fetch and will not leave you 
            alone with her toys as she begs you to play with her.</P>
            <p>
            Rosie is also a wonderful lap dog. If you sit on the couch she is quick to find a 
            spot next to you. If you wear a blanket over your legs, you’ll find her laying on 
            your legs. She loves to cuddle and loves to be pet so she will always be right up 
            on you.</p>
